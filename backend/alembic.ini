[post_write_hooks]
# post_write_hooks defines scripts or Python functions that are to be
# called by various Alembic commands after they complete, to provide
# additional functionality.
#
# The entry_points can be "console_scripts" (the default) or "sqlalchemy.command"
# (non-default) to reference the appropriate set of entry points.
#
# For each post_write_hook entry, the entry_point should refer to a function
# that accepts a single argument, the location of the script to execute.
# The location will be the .py file corresponding to the script.
#
# The "type" can be one of:
# "process" - default, runs the script as a subprocess
# "multiprocess" - runs the script as a subprocess, but in parallel
# "callable" - calls the function directly
#
# Additionally, an "arguments" parameter can be specified as a comma-
# separated list of arguments to be passed to the script or function.
